📘 Student Placement Performance: A Story Told Through Data
In analyzing the placement outcomes of 5,000 students, several patterns emerge that highlight the academic and experiential factors influencing success.

🎓 Gender and Placement
The placement distribution between male and female students is nearly equal. Out of 2,496 female students, 425 were placed, while 441 out of 2,504 male students secured placements. This suggests that gender does not significantly impact placement chances, indicating a balanced recruitment approach.

📈 CGPA Matters
Academic performance plays a clear role. Placed students have an average CGPA of 8.43, compared to 7.52 for not placed. This reinforces the importance of consistent academic effort — higher CGPA correlates strongly with placement success.

🧮 Backlogs Hurt Placement
When visualized by backlog count, the data reveals a steep drop in placement rates. Students with zero backlogs dominate placement charts, while those with 3 or more backlogs show nearly zero placement. This highlights how academic discipline and course completion are critical for employability.

🛠️ Live Projects Boost Outcomes
Students with more live project experience show higher placement numbers. The chart shows a clear upward trend: those with 2+ live projects are far more likely to be placed. This suggests that hands-on experience and real-world exposure are key differentiators in the job market.

🧠 Final Insight
“Placement success is driven by a combination of strong academics (high CGPA, no backlogs) and practical experience (live projects). Gender parity is evident, but students with poor academic standing or limited exposure struggle to secure offers.”
